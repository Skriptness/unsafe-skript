# unsafe-skript
*True reflection capabilities for Skript*

unsafe-skript is a [Skript](https://github.com/SkriptLang/Skript) addon providing true [reflection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflective_programming) capabilities. It was created and tested on the `2.7.0-beta3` Skript version. Support for other versions is not guaranteed.

### Features include:
- dynamic function calling
- run-time modifications of function signatures (parameters, return type)
- run-time overwriting of function bodies (works on Java-implemented functions too!)

*...and much more to come...*
